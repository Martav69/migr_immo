# migr_immo – Professional Services for Property Management & Accounting

## About Migr

Migr is a specialized brand offering expert, tailored services to syndics and property managers involved in co-ownership ("copropriétés") accounting and management across France. Migr is not a software product but a trusted partner providing essential operational solutions around property management accounting, migration, auditing, and outsourcing.

## Sector and Context

The French property management sector, particularly co-ownership accounting and management, is highly regulated and demanding. Property managers (syndics) must comply with strict accounting and legal obligations including transparent fund management, timely reporting, audits, and maintaining close relationships with property owners and stakeholders. Many syndics, especially smaller and mid-sized ones, require reliable external partners to provide accounting expertise and help with transitions between management software or new property portfolios.

Migr fills this crucial niche by offering deployment-ready, flexible services that target the real pain points of this sector: software migration, onboarding new co-ownerships, precise financial accounting, temporary or permanent staff replacement, and legal audit and fund control. Their deep market experience (10+ years) enables them to service both large property groups and independent syndics with discretion, agility, and bespoke solutions tailored to the client’s size and specific needs.

## Core Services

1. **Express Software Migration:** Fast, secure transitions from one property management software to another. Migr ensures that no data is lost and that all historical accounting and legal documents remain accessible and compliant.
   
2. **New Property Onboarding:** Migr manages the accounting and administrative takeover process for new co-ownerships, allowing syndics to expand their portfolio without operational strain.

3. **Tailored Accounting Services:** Flexible offerings such as bank reconciliations, account preparation, cash flow entry (invoices, receipts), and other bookkeeping tasks performed with precision and compliance.

4. **Accounting Staff Replacement:** Temporary or long-term replacement of accounting professionals to cover leaves, peaks, or departures, ensuring continuity and reliability without recruitment delays.

5. **Complete Outsourcing:** Full delegation of property accounting and management responsibilities, allowing syndics to focus on client relationships and operational priorities.

6. **Audit and Guarantee Fund Management:** Specialized audits and regulatory compliance checks, including rigorous control of guarantee funds, a key requirement in the co-ownership sector.
